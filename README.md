## NOISE REDUCTION using Fuzzy Filtering

## Fuzzy Edge Detection in Images

Codes are written as MATLAB scripts that process input image "image.jpg" and show the output.
### HOW TO RUN : 

The program processes file "image.jpg". Please place the file alongwith the .m files.

1) Run the program :
```sh
   Run script in MATLAB
 ```
 
 Large images may take some time to be processed.

Final output is displayed in a window and saved on disk as well.
